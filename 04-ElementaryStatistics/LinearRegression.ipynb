    "This notebook is designed to guide you in learning how to do a basic linear regression using Python. The notebook will be divided into two parts. In the first, we will create data with some known function. Then, we will add some random fluctuations to the data and see if we can recover the function. In the second part, we will use a public dataset to test this schema and perform the linear regression.\n",

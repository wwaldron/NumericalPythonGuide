    "# Python Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "[Python](https://www.python.org) is a powerful, high-level programming laanguage. Python is a free interpretted scripting language with a large user base (just see all the Python projects on [Github](https://github.com/)). In this class, you will primarily be introduced to Python via three methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The Command-Line Interface (Console or Terminal Interface)\n",
    "  - Test Code\n",
    "  - Run Quick Commands\n",
    "  - Use as a Fancy Calculator\n",
    "  - Quickly open and parse data\n",
    "2. Python Script/Package Files (files ending with py)\n",
    "  - Run multiple commands\n",
    "  - Build functions for later use\n",
    "  - Create packages (large python projects)\n",
    "3. Python Notebooks (where I suspect we will spend most of our time)\n",
    "  - Exploratory Data Analysis\n",
    "  - Interactive Programming and Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python Terminal\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's begin by calling your running your first Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Open the Windows \"Start\" menu\n",
    "- Type out \"Anaconda Prompt\" and run the program\n",
    "  - This is nothing more than a Windows Command Prompt with Python visible to the system\n",
    "- Simply type `ipython` at the command line and hit *Enter*\n",
    "  - *IPython* is a version of Python known as Interactive Python\n",
    "  - Basically it just has a few more bells and whistles than the basic Python interpreter\n",
    "- At this point, you should be running Python!\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll begin where every programming class begin with a simple \"Hello World\" Program. Simply type\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print('Hello World!')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "on the command line and hit *Enter*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations! You have just run your first line of Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's unpack what just happened.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You told the Python interpretter to call the `print` function.\n",
    "2. The `print` function then called the single *argument* you passed into the function which was simply the **string** `'Hello World'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's all there is to it. You give Python the high-level commands and it does the rest!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have introduced the **string** data type, let's take a moment to introduce ourselves to other Python data types. While Python has many datatypes, we'll focus on a select few for today.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Numerical Types](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/stdtypes.html#numeric-types-int-float-complex)\n",
    "  - [`int`](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/functions.html#int) - For numerical variables with no decimals\n",
    "  - [`float`](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/functions.html#float) - For numerical variables with decimals\n",
    "  - [`complex`](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/functions.html#complex) - For numerical variables with complex values\n",
    "2. [Sequences](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/stdtypes.html#sequence-types-list-tuple-range)\n",
    "  - [`list`](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/stdtypes.html#list) - A *mutable* sequence type (similar to an array in MATLAB)\n",
    "  - [`tuple`](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/stdtypes.html#tuple) - An *immutable* sequence type\n",
    "  - [`range`](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/stdtypes.html#range) - A Sequence used for iterating over integers\n",
    "3. [Text Sequences (Strings)](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/stdtypes.html#text-sequence-type-str)\n",
    "  - [`str`](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/stdtypes.html#str) - A simple text string (similar to a `C++` style string\n",
    "4. [Mappings](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/stdtypes.html#mapping-types-dict)\n",
    "  - [`dict`](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/stdtypes.html#dict) - A mutable container that functions like a list, but is referenced with specific keys\n",
    "\n",
    "### Numerical Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's utilize some of these basic types. Begin by running the following lines (separately)\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "2 + 2\n",
    "type(2 + 2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "and notice how the output is an integer. Then run\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "2 + 2.0\n",
    "type(2 + 2.0)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "and notice how the type changes. Python is generally pretty good at casting between types. In the first case, you added two **ints** together and the result was also an **int**. However, in the second case, you added an **int** and a **float** and Python chose to output in the more complicated data type to ensure no information is lost from the float.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another thing to note about Python is that it does *implicit* printing. In the first line of code you ran, you manually typed the `print` function. Whereas, in the above code, you left that out. However, Python assumed that you wanted to print the output since there was nothing more complicated going on.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use the type functions to manually cast data yourself. For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "int(2.4)\n",
    "float('2.4')  # Python can cast str to numerical!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's conversion are endless and one can actually write more complex datatypes that can convert to these simple types.\n",
    "\n",
    "The previous example also introduced us to another feature that is common to all languages: the **comment**. In Python, one can comment code by using the `#` symbol. Anything after a `#` will be ignored by the interpretter.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sequences\n",
    "\n",
    "As stated above, Python has three main sequence types. The lines below give an example of each.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "[0, 'a', 4.2]  # A list denoted with []\n",
    "(0, 'a', 4.2)  # A tuple denoted with ()\n",
    "range(10)      # Range is called with the range function\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A few things to note here.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Python sequence types do not have to have the same data type for each element.\n",
    "2. Lists and Tuples can be created directly as they are above\n",
    "  - They can also be created with the `list` and `tuple` functions\n",
    "3. `range` is rarely used by itself\n",
    "  - `range` is used to create quick lists/tuple\n",
    "  - It is used for a quick and easy iterator (but we'll get to that later)\n",
    "  - See example below\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "list(range(10))  # A Quick List\n",
    "tuple(range(10)) # A Quick Tuple\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "One more thing to note: Python is *inclusive* on start values and *exclusive* on end values. For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "list(range(2, 6))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "only returns `[2, 3, 4, 5]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like any other programming language, Python supports variable assignment which is done with the `=` operator. This is simply done by\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = 2\n",
    "b = 3\n",
    "c = a + b\n",
    "print(c)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point `a, b` and `c` all reference the values given to them by the assignment. Unlike C++ and other compile languages, variables are not prohibitted to a particular type. For example, I can reuse the same variables over and over again (although this is generally not encouraged outside the commandline.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = 'This is '\n",
    "b = 'a string.'\n",
    "c = a + b\n",
    "print(c)\n",
    "\n",
    "a = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "b = [4, 5, 6]\n",
    "c = a + b\n",
    "print(c)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll notice a few things at this point.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We were able to assign multiple types to `a, b` and `c`\n",
    "2. The `+` operator serves as the typical *addition* operator\n",
    "3. The `+` operator also serves as an *append* operation for sequences\n",
    "\n",
    "One can also access elements in a list. This is done with *zero-based* indexing (unlike MATLAB). Therefore, the access the first element of `c`, one would use\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(c[0])\n",
    "print(c[-1])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, we also see an example of Python's ability to access elements from the end. By using the `-` sign in the element access, we access the end elements beginning with `-1, -2, ...`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's end today's lesson by talking about dictionaries. Dictionaries act similar to lists, but are indexed by a key rather than an integer index. For example, I can create a dictionary like the one below using the `{key: element}` syntax. Then, I can later access data with the same keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "d = {'a': 'Hello', 77: 'World!', 'name': 'Waldron'}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the keys and items can all be different types. The only rule concerning the keys is that they must be an *immutable* type. Now, I can retrieve the data with\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(d['a'])\n",
    "print(d[77])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionaries can also have items added after creation. For example, running `d['age'] = 28` adds a new value with the key `'age'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recreating this Notebook (Commands)\n",
    "\n",
    "Take all the Python code and save it to a script called `hello_world.py`. Your instructor will walk you through the process of creating and calling the script.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating Your Own Script\n",
    "\n",
    "Create your own script with the following. Your instructor will also help.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First print the traditional `'Hello World!'` string.\n",
    "2. Ask for the user's name and save it to a variable called `name`.\n",
    "  - You will use the `input` function in Python\n",
    "  - `name = input('What is your name?')  # Always saves as str`\n",
    "3. Ask the user's age and save it as an `int` type to the variable `age`.\n",
    "4. Print `Hello, <User's Name>!`\n",
    "5. Print `You are <User's Age> years old.`\n",
    "6. Print `In five years, you will be <User's Age in 5 years> years old.`\n",
    "7. Print `Have a great day!`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Things to Remember\n",

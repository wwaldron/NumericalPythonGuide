    "# Introduction to Python Control Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is designed to teach you about the [control structures](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html) that exist in Python. In general, Python does not really add to nor take away from the standard control structures found in other languages (although there are a few exceptions most notably in syntax).\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic control statements are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `if` statements\n",
    "* `for` statements\n",
    "* The `range` function (which we covered last week)\n",
    "* `break`\n",
    "* `continue`\n",
    "* `else`\n",
    "* `elif`\n",
    "* `pass`\n",
    "\n",
    "While this may seem like a lot to cover, the main ones to know are the first two. Everything else in the list helps you create branches in the code based on a given condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The `if` Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "As in other languages, the `if` statment tests whether a given condition is `True` or not. If the test passes (e.g., the statement/condition is true) the code within the block is executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, before we dive into the code, make note regarding one of Python's syntax features being the tabbing structures. In some languages, a control block requires a set of braces or an end statement. Python, however, defines a block beginnine with a colon and then with tabbed code following (generally being four spaces). Consider the example below.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if x > 0:  # Control Block begins (note trailing colon)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Lines tabbed underneath are within the control block\n",
    "    x -= 1  # Decrement x\n",
    "    x += 1  # Increment x\n",
    "\n",
    "# Lines outside the control block\n",
    "x = -5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### `if` Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's try this out on some real code below."

    "1. I began the control structure as stated with `if`, a condition and a colon\n",
    "2. The next block is known as an `elif` block which is short for \"else if\"\n",
    "  * This allows another condition to be run on `x` to potentially run the code within its block\n",
    "  * Go ahead and try changing `x` to some negative value\n",
    "3. The final block is the `else` block\n",
    "  * This block only runs if the previous conditions fail\n",
